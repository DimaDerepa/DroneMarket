    <h3>Shipping Costs & Timing</h3><br><br>
    <h4>Shipping Cost</h4><br><br>
Shipping cost is calculated on a "per order," "per item" or "per pound" basis and is based on the shipping option you select. We sometimes offer free shipping for specific shipping options in select categories, or free shipping sitewide.
<br><br>
<h4>Shipping Timing</h4><br><br>
You can see each product's estimated arrival date on the product page and during the checkout process. During checkout, you can choose an estimated arrival date from the options provided. Same Day Delivery is available in select areas and ZIP codes Sundayâ€“Saturday, excluding holidays. Same Day Delivery orders must be placed before 3 p.m. local time (Sunday order deadline is 2 p.m.); orders placed after the deadline will be delivered the next day.
<br><br>
Entering your shipping destination ZIP code or allowing BestBuy.com to use your current location can result in greater accuracy for your estimated arrival date. Certain products may require additional days to process prior to shipping. This will be reflected in the estimated arrival date. If for some reason you don't receive your product, you may be eligible for a replacement product if you notify us during your return and exchange time period.
<br><br>
<h4>Title to Products</h4><br><br>
Purchases of product through BestBuy.com are subject to a destination contract. This means that the risk of loss and title for these products passes to you upon the carrier's delivery to your ship-to address.
