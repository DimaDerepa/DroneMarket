    <h3>Terms and Conditions</h3><br><br>
[Last Updated February 15, 2019]<br><br>

Welcome to Best Buy. The BestBuy.com website, Best Buy mobile and iPad apps, and our mobile Best Buy site are collectively the "Best Buy Properties" and each individually is a "Best Buy Property." By using any Best Buy Property and its related services, products, and software, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions ("Terms"). You also accept the Terms when you create an account, make a purchase as a guest, or log in to any Best Buy Property. Additional or separate terms may apply to your interactions with other Best Buy websites, Best Buy or Geek Squad® locations, and to your use of individual services or features available on a Best Buy Property, such as reviews. To the extent that the provisions of any additional terms conflict with these Terms, the provisions of the additional terms will govern. References to "Best Buy," "Geek Squad," “Magnolia,” “Magnolia Home Theater,” “Magnolia Design Center,” "our," "we," or "us" may refer to Best Buy Co., Inc., BestBuy.com, LLC, Best Buy Stores, L.P., BBY Solutions, Inc., Best Buy Enterprise Services, Inc., Magnolia Hi-Fi, LLC, and their affiliates, subsidiaries, and designees. We may make changes to any Best Buy Property and the Terms. It is your responsibility to review the Terms for updates or changes. If you do not agree with the Terms, you should not use the Best Buy Properties.
<br><br>
<h4>Use of the Best Buy Properties</h4><br><br>
You may use the Best Buy Properties for your personal, noncommercial use only. You may not use any Best Buy Property if you are under the age of 13. If you are between the ages of 13 and 18, you may use the Best Buy Properties only with involvement of a parent or guardian.
<br><br>
<h4>Privacy</h4><br><br>
Your use of the Best Buy Properties is subject to our Privacy Policy. Please review the policy for more on how we collect and use information.
<br><br>
<h4>Information on Our Site</h4><br><br>
We try to be as accurate as possible with the information we present on the Best Buy Properties. We will make reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of the products we sell. We do not warrant that product descriptions or other content is accurate, complete, or error free. Prices and promotions are subject to change, and may vary from those offered in our stores. We cannot confirm the availability or price of an item until you place your order. Despite our best efforts, sometimes an item in our catalog may not be available, the offer may have been misstated, or an item may be mispriced. For any of these reasons, we may cancel your order or we may contact you for instructions on the order.
<br><br>
<h4>Paying for Your Order</h4><br><br>
Generally, we'll charge your payment method for an item when we ship the item to you or confirm its availability in store. However, we may preauthorize your order amount with your credit card, credit account, or debit card issuer at the time you place the order, which may have an effect on your available credit line. When you pre-order with a debit card, we'll debit your card when you place the pre-order. For special delivery items, we'll charge your payment method when you confirm a delivery time. For digital items, we'll charge your payment method when you initiate the download of the product or the product is placed in your account and available for use.
<br><br>
<h4>Order Confirmation</h4><br><br>
Our order confirmation to you does not signify our acceptance of your order, nor does it constitute confirmation of our offer to sell. At any time after receipt of your order, we may accept, decline, or place quantity or other limits on your order for any reason. We may impose these limits on a per-person, per-household, per-order, or any other basis. If we reject, limit, or otherwise modify your order, we will attempt to notify you using the email address you provide to us. If we cancel an order or part of an order that we've already charged you for, we'll refund you the full amount of the canceled portion of the order.
